# ISS Tracker

This project contains the software needed to run an ISS Tracker. Currently, the plan is to run a Python script that gets and calculates the alt/az data for the ISS on a Raspberry Pi. It would then communicate these values to an arduino connected to some servos and a pointer, which would change its position with new data.
